assumes git is installed

This file is to encapsulate the manual steps
before turning them into ansible/terraform specs

on a node host in the /home/$USER folder

git clone https://github.com/CubeSpawn/VM_Cluster.git
 

first install docker-machine on the host

In /home/@USER/VM_Cluster/bin folder
run 
$ inst_docker-machine.sh
then:
docker-machine create  -d virtualbox --virtualbox-boot2docker-url https://releases.rancher.com/os/latest/rancheros.iso --virtualbox-memory 3072 CS-VM-0x

Once the virtual machine is running connect with docker-machine ssh CS-VM-03

you'll be at the 

docker@CS-VM-03:~$
sudo su
now your at the root prompt
root@CS-VM-03:~# 

run
passwd rancher
I used "cubespawn" as the password

I then used the virtualbox GUI to set "Adapter 2 to "bridged" 
under the "advanced" dropdown
I set promiscuous mode to "Allow All" 

back at the root prompt, 
I set the RancherOS console to "Ubuntu" with
ros console switch Ubuntu
this swaps out the consol container and reboots the interface, but not the VM
dropping you back to the host console

reconnect with docker-machine ssh CS-VM-03
set the eth2 interface to an IPv4 address reachable from your LAN with
ifconfig eth2 10.42.0.43 netmask 255.255.255.0

you should now be able to ssh to the VM from your jump server with
ssh rancher@10.42.0.43
